# UnityRO
Ragnarok Online was released in 2002, thus its engine is severely outdated.
This project aims to port some of its functionalities to a modern engine, Unity.
At the moment, UnityRO is fully functional as a map viewer.

## Current Features

Dynamic GRF loading

Realtime lighting and shadows

## What's next

Fixing ground texture seams if possible

Figure out a way to display lights (Unity doesn't like hundreds of point lights added at runtime).
The game itself probably uses billboard overlays to fake them.

## How to use

I'll be releasing a standalone executable soonâ„¢
