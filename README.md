# UnityRO
Ragnarok Online was released in 2002, thus its engine is severely outdated.
This project aims to port some of its functionalities to a modern engine, Unity.
At the moment, UnityRO is fully functional as a map viewer.

## What's next

Figure out a way to display lights (Unity doesn't like hundreds of point lights added at runtime).
The game itself probably uses billboard overlays to fake them.

## How to use

Download executable or Unity package [here](https://github.com/guilhermelhr/unityro/releases/).
Edit config.txt to point to your GRF file.
